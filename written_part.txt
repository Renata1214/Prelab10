1. How does heapsort work? Explain your answer and then use pseudocode to illustrate the
solution.



2. What is a leftist heap? Show an example.
A leftist tree is a type of binary tree-based data structure used to
 implement priority queues. It maintains a property where the "leftist" subtree of any node is always 
 at least as tall as the right subtree.
 The priority of the node is determined by its key value, and the node with the smallest key value is 
 designated as the root node.

Leftist trees allow merge operation, which allows two trees to be combined while maintaining the leftist property.The 
    tree with the smaller root value is merged into the tree with the larger root value.
    Insertion and deletion operations in leftist trees involve maintaining the leftist property and possibly 
    performing merge operations to maintain balance.
